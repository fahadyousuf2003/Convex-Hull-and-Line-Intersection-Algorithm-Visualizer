# Convex Hull and Line Intersection Algorithm Visualization

## Introduction
The provided Python code implements algorithms for computing the convex hull of a set of points in a 2D plane. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that encloses all the given points. The implemented algorithms include the brute force method, Jarvis March, Graham Scan, Quick Elimination combined with Graham Scan, and Monotone Chain. The visualization tool, built using Tkinter-based GUI, allows users to generate random points on a canvas, apply different convex hull algorithms, and observe step-by-step visualizations of each algorithm's construction. The tool also includes functionality to check for line intersections using both the Graham Scan algorithm and the Slope-Intercept method.

## Program Design
The implementation is done in Python, utilizing the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface. The code includes classes and functions representing geometric entities like points and convex hulls. The GUI facilitates user interaction, allowing random point generation, algorithm selection, and step-by-step visualization. Design decisions, such as the use of classes for points and encapsulation of algorithms, contribute to the code's readability and maintainability.

## Experimental Setup
### 0.1 Dataset
The experimental setup involves the canvas where random points are generated by the user through the GUI. The number and distribution of these points are determined by the user's choice.
### 0.2 Environment
The code does not involve an extensive experimental setup in terms of hardware or external dependencies. It runs on any environment supporting Python and Tkinter.
### 0.3 Parameters
While the user can interactively control parameters such as the number of generated points, the code's core algorithms do not have specific configurable parameters.

## Results
This section involves the interactive visualization of the convex hull construction process. Screenshots or visual outputs of the GUI during different stages of the algorithm execution are presented.
